# Solar System Visualization

This project is an interactive 3D visualization of the Solar System, often referred to as an "orrery" or a digital planetarium. It allows users to explore the planets and their orbits around the Sun, providing a realistic representation of the size, distance, and movement of each celestial body.

## Features

- **Interactive Orbits:** Realistic representation of planetary orbits, showing the movement of planets around the Sun.
- **Planet Selection:** Users can select a planet from the list to focus the camera on it, providing a detailed view.
- **Information Panel:** Upon selecting a planet, an information panel displays key facts such as the planet's name, mass, radius, orbital period, and number of moons.
- **Camera Controls:** Smooth camera movement to zoom in and out, rotate around planets, and follow their paths.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js:** For creating and rendering the 3D models and animations.
- **JavaScript:** For interactivity and controlling the visualization.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the interface.
- **dat.GUI:** For user interface controls like speed adjustment.

## How to Use

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Use the list to select a planet, which will move the camera to focus on it.
3. Zoom in or out to explore each planet and its orbit.
4. View detailed information about each planet in the information panel.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Enter npm install in terminal 
5. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the application.
